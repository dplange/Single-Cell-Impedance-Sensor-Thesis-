  abstract = {A novel MEMS based system for flow cytometry is presented based on a multispectral approach. The solution provides the ability to concurrently generate, detect and analyse the response from a biological cell using multiple narrow band signals with a frequency separation sufficient to evoke different cellular responses. The narrow band approach limits the energy required and provides an improved signal to noise ratio for a given transmitter energy, avoiding wide band signal power dissipation and dilution issues. It requires only a single transmitter and receiver interface to the MEMS device with no duplication of analogue signal paths. The design has the ability to generate a complex multi frequency waveform with a wide frequency separation. A digital approach based on the CORDIC algorithm (Volder, IRE Trans Electron Comput EC-8:330–334, 1959) was used to generate the required sinusoidal waveforms. The digital section of the design was implemented on an FPGA. It utilised a modified digital phase sensitive amplifier to provide enhanced signal to noise performance and harmonic rejection. A novel hybrid, cross channel electrode structure to implement the stimulus and response analysis sub-system has been designed. A fully functional macroscopic test bench has been constructed to demonstrate the viability of the approach. Both physical measurements and finite element data has been used to demonstrate the potential for migration into a MEMS based system.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the keypoints to perform multifrequency simultaneous bioimpedance measurements using multitone signals. Concerning the frequency distribution, tones are spread over 1kHz to 1MHz range using a custom frequency distribution which we called Bilateral Quasi Logarithmic (BQL). BQL concentrates a higher number of tones around the impedance relaxation and contains a frequency plan algorithm. It minimizes the intermodulation effects due to non-linearities behaviours of the DUT and electrodes by slightly shifting the original tones in order to guarantee a guard bandwith. Regarding the multitone phase distribution, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been developed to minimize multitone Crest Factor (CF). This allow us to maximize the resultant Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the acquisition system. This paper also presents the relation between parameters such as sampling frequency and ADC bits with the SNR and the effect in the overall amplitude and phase error when using multitone signals as excitation waveforms. Finally, we present characterization results from a measurement system based on a modular PXI architecture.},

  abstract = {Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can be used to characterize biological materials in applications ranging from cell culture to body composition, including tissue and organ state. The emergence of cell therapy and tissue engineering opens up a new and promising field of application. While in most cases classical measurement techniques based on a frequency sweep can be used, EIS based on broadband excitations enables dynamic biological systems to be characterized when the measuring time and injected energy are a constraint. Myocardial regeneration, cell characterization in micro-fluidic systems and dynamic electrical impedance tomography are all examples of such applications. The weakness of such types of fast EIS measuring techniques resides in their intrinsic loss of accuracy. However, since most of the practical applications have no restriction over the excitation used, the input power spectrum can be appropriately designed to maximize the accuracy obtained from the measurements. This paper deals with the problem of designing the optimal multisine excitation for electrical bioimpedance measurements. The optimal multisine is obtained by the minimization of the Cramer–Rao lower bound, or what is the same, by maximizing the accuracy obtained from the measurements. Furthermore, because no analytical solution exists for global optimization involving time and frequency domains jointly, this paper presents the multisine optimization approach partially in both domains and then combines the results. As regards the frequency domain approach, a novel contribution is made for the multisine amplitude power spectrum. In the time domain, multisine is optimized by reducing its crest factor. Moreover, the impact on the information and accuracy of the impedance spectrum obtained from using different multisine amplitude power spectra is discussed, as well as the number of frequencies and frequency distributions. The theory is supported by a set of validation measurements when exciting with the optimal and flat multisine signals and compared to a single frequency ac impedance analyzer when characterizing an RC circuit. In vivo healthy myocardium tissue electrical impedance measurements show that broadband EIS based on multisine excitations enable the characterization of dynamic biological systems.},

In many of the named applications it is necessary to measure the complex dielectric constant of a sample as a function of frequency. Therefore the developed system is capable of measuring amplitude and especially high precision phase of the measurement signal over a wide frequency range from 10 Hz to 10 MHz. The experimental result of the new method shows a phase resolution of up to 0.01 degree at 1 MHz and 0.1 degree at 10 MHz. The excellent phase measurement resolution is achieved by a time transformation of the signal using a digital sampling circuitry. The functional principle of the digital sampling circuitry is based on Delta – Modulation and is implemented inside a cheap standard FPGA. The new system is successfully used in blood analysis applications and allows for a practical implementation of cost efficient capacitive hematocrit sensors for the first time.},

Also, the impedance of cardiovascular system is dynamic. Measurements must be as short as possible to avoid significant impedance changes during the spectrum analysis and, at the same time, as long as possible for enlarging the excitation energy. The authors propose to use specific short chirp pulses for excitation. Thanks to unique properties of the chirp function, it is possible to meet the needs for spectrum bandwidth, measurement time, and signal-to-noise ratio so that the most accurate impedance spectrogram is obtained. The chirp wave excitation pulse can include thousands of cycles when the impedance changes slowly, but in the case of very high-speed changes it can be even shorter than a single cycle, preserving the same excitation bandwidth. For example, 100 kHz bandwidth can be covered by the chirp pulse with duration from 10 μs to 1 s, only its excitation energy differs also 10 5 times.},

  abstract = {Dielectric spectroscopy is a powerful tool for investigating the dielectric properties of biological particles in suspension. For low volume fractions, the dielectric properties of the particles are related to the measured properties of the suspension by Maxwell's mixture equation. A number of different techniques can be used to measure the dielectric spectrum in the frequency domain or the time domain. In time domain dielectric spectroscopy, data can be converted into the frequency domain using convolution or Fourier transform, prior to data analysis. In this paper, we present a general method for transforming Maxwell's mixture equation from the frequency domain to the time domain allowing analysis of cell dielectric properties directly in the time domain. The derivation is based on the Laplace transform of the single shell model for a spherical particle, and can be extended to the multi-shell model. For a single shelled cell two characteristic relaxation time constants are derived. The results are compared with published analytical models. We show that the original frequency dependent mixture equation can be recovered by Fourier transform back to the frequency domain. As a result, a general relationship for the dielectric response of a mixture of particles is presented which links the frequency and time domains.},

  abstract = {Impedance measurements provide basic electrical properties and are used to analyze the characteristics of electrochemical materials for biomedical applications. The extracellular fluid (ECF) in microfluidic devices greatly affects the accuracy of impedance measurements of cells. When a single cell is placed in large amounts of ECF, the electric current mostly passes through the ECF, not the cell. Hence, this work presents a modeling method that is demonstrated in numerical and analytical solutions for eliminating the effect of ECF in coplanar impedance sensors. The proposed modeling method uses fundamental formulas of circuits that include the electrical parameters of the ECF, cytoplasm, and cell membrane. Equivalent circuit models for the coplanar impedance sensor are established to simulate the impedance as well as the measured ones for excitation frequencies in the range of 11–101 kHz. According to the calculation result using the proposed modeling method, the cytoplasm resistance, membrane capacitance, medium resistance, and medium capacitance of HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma) cell are 13.5 kΩ, 122.6 pF, 27.9 kΩ, and 337.7 pF, respectively. Moreover, the electric current distribution in the coplanar impedance sensor is investigated using finite element method (FEM) simulation software. The variation in the impedance during measurements with the simultaneous application of an alternating-current (AC) voltage amplitude of 0.4 Vpp in the fluid volume range of 9–144 µL is also studied.},

  abstract = {SummaryThe interfacial polarization of spherical dispersions is dealt with theoretically, and is discussed for the actual cases of emulsions.First it is shown that theMaxwell theory is not valid qualitatively for the dielectric properties of emulsions. Next the general solution of theWagner theory is derived. This solution shows that a dielectric dispersion due to the interfacial polarization is characterized by a single relaxation time. It is found that theWagner theory is not valid quantitatively for the actual emulsions.Finally a new theory of the interfacial polarization is developed on the assumption that theWagner equation holds for an infinitesimally increasing process in concentration of the dispersion system. Several dielectric properties of emulsions are interpreted quantitatively by this new theory. Dielectric dispersions due to the interfacial polarization have so far been observed only in the W/O emulsions, and no example of the interfacial polarization has been found in usual emulsions of the O/W type yet. According to the new theory it is suggested that, if the dielectric constant of the oil phase is much larger, the dielectric dispersion due to the interfacial polarization may be observed even in emulsions of the O/W type.},

We summarize the classical principles behind dielectric relaxation and critically review recent developments in this field. Special topics include a summary of the significant recent advances in theories of counterion polarization effects, dielectric properties of cancer vs. normal tissues, properties of low-water-content tissues, and macroscopic field-coupling considerations. Finally, the dielectric properties of tissues are summarized as empirical correlations with tissue water content in other compositional variables; in addition, a comprehensive table is presented of dielectric properties. The bulk electrical properties of tissues are needed for many bioengineering applications of electric fields or currents, and they provide insight into the basic mechanisms that govern the interaction of electric fields with tissue.},

They change with frequency in three distinct steps and their dielectric constants reach enormous values at low frequencies. The author concentrates on the “linear” properties observed with applied fields less than about 1 V/cm. The linear properties of interest include the dielectric constant ε and conductivity σ. Extensive measurements have been carried out over a broad frequency range extending from less than 1 Hz to many GHz. A number of mechanism have been identified which explain the observed data. These mechanisms reflect the various compartments of the biological material. These include membranes and their properties, biological macromolecules and fluid compartments inside and outside membranes. The authors summarize the mechanisms which contribute to the total frequency response},

If it be assumed that biological systems are equivalent to such a network, the hypotheses are supported at low and intermediate frequencies by data on red blood cells, muscle, nerve, and potato.

The measuring cells were so constructed that electrolytes of any desired concentration could be circulated during the course of the measurements. The cellulose wall which surrounds the cell is found to play an important part in the interpretation of the results obtained. In a mature cell, this cellulose has a specific resistance of about 1000 ohm cm. which is independent of the medium in which the cell is suspended. The thickness of the wall is computed to be about 10 µ. The cell membrane is found to be virtually non-conducting, and to have a capacity of 0.94 µf./cm.2 ± 10 per cent and a phase angle of 80° ± 4°.
The specific resistances of the sap were difficult to compute from data on living cells and were unsatisfactory because they were very much dependent upon the medium, while measurements on extracted sap gave 58 ohm cm. ± 8 per cent which was independent of the medium. There are indications that the chloroplasts have impedance properties similar to those of living cells.},

be imposed on particles of sizes ranging from proteins and viruses to micro-organisms and cells. Each type of particle
responds to the forces exerted on them in a unique way, allowing for their controlled and selective manipulation as well
as their characterization. Moreover, particles of the same type but of different viability can be distinguished in a simple,
reliable manner. This review outlines the principles that govern the way in which bioparticles respond to these various
field types, and how they can be exploited. Examples of current and potential biotechnological and biomedical applications
are given, along with a critical comparison of current techniques.},

The new tensor expressions for the moments satisfy the requirement of symmetry. When combined with previously derived expressions for the induced moments in terms of the electric field and its derivatives, the theory accommodates electrically linear spherical particles with any type of ohmic or dielectric loss in any sinusoidally-varying electric field. The special case of a plant protoplast suspended in an aqueous medium and subjected to a traveling electric field wave is chosen to demonstrate the theory's easy adaptation to the practical planar or multi-planar microelectrode geometries now used to move, rotate, or position small particles such as biological cells.},

Compared with dielectric spectroscopy, these methods offer a measure of independence from electrode artifacts and mixture theory. On the assumption that the particles can be modeled as uniform dielectric objects with effective dielectric properties, a simple theory can be developed for the frequency variation in the field-induced forces. For particles exhibiting counterion polarization, dielectrophoretic forces differ considerably from predictions of this theory at low frequencies, apparently because of double layer phenomena.},

  abstract = {Electrorotation (ER) is a technique allowing the characterization of the surface properties of a variety of supra-molecular aggregates and living cultured cells as well as cellular organelles and biological materials in general. In particular, this technique allows measuring two important physical parameters of the cell membrane: specific capacitance and specific conductance. These parameters are strictly related to the structure/function relationships of the biological membrane; ER becomes thus a powerful means to investigate a number of phenomena involving the membrane integrity. These phenomena may originate from treatments with exogenous molecules and/or from pathological effects. Concerning these aspects, the study of the transfer of exogenous material (i.e. cat-anionic vesicles or liposomes) across the cell membrane assumes a high importance. This review is focused on the physical functioning principles of ER and on the quantitative analysis of the experimental measurements. This work also reports on different fields of application of ER with particular reference to data obtained in our laboratory. The investigation of the alterations of the cytoplasmic membrane function, as evidenced by this strategy, will be illustrated in detail.},

The complete circuit model, which includes the resistance of the shell layer and the capacitance of the inner core, has been used to determine the permittivity and conductivity in the shell of single capsules. The PSpice circuit simulations, based on the developed complete circuit models, are used to analyze the experimental data. The relative permittivity of the polyelectrolyte capsule shell is determined to be 50, and the conductivities of the shells of six- and nine-layer microcapsules are estimated to be 28 ± 6 and 3.3 ± 1.7 mS m−1, respectively.},

  abstract = {In their article, ‘‘AC frequency characteristics of coplanar impedance sensors as design parameters’’, Hong et al.1 present an analytical model for the calculation of the resistance between two electrodes in a microchannel. However, their measurements fit poorly with their suggested model, and they attribute the discrepancies to electrode thickness and a ‘fringing effect’. In this note we show that the discrepancies are due to the neglected channel height in their model, and that by including two additional transformations, the resistance between two electro-des in a microchannel can be accurately modelled. The cell constant describes the proportionality between the resistivity of the medium in contact with two electrodes and the resulting resistance. The usefulness of the cell constant for microelectrode design optimization has been presented pre-viously.2,3 Both these papers treat sensor design for coplanar},

  abstract = {A new cytological tool, based on the microCoulter particle counter (microCPC) principle, aimed at diagnostic applications for cell counting and separation in haematology, oncology or toxicology is described. The device measures the spectral impedance of individual cells or particles and allows screening rates over 100 samples s(-1) on a single-cell basis. This analyzer is intended to drive a sorting actuator producing a subsequent cell separation. Size reduction and integration of functions are essential in achieving precise measurements and high throughput. 3D finite element simulations are presented to compare various electrode geometries and their influence on cell parameters estimation. The device is based on a glass-polyimide microfluidic chip with integrated channels and electrodes microfabricated at the length scale of the particles to be investigated (1-20 microm). A laminar liquid flow carries the suspended particles through the measurement area. Each particle's impedance signal is recorded by a differential pair of microelectrodes using the cell surrounding media as a reference. The micromachined chip and processing electronic circuit allow simultaneous impedance measurements at multiple frequencies, ranging from 100 kHz to 15 MHz. In this paper, we describe the microfabrication and characterisation of an on-chip flow-cytometer as the first building block of a complete cell-sorting device. We then discuss the signal conditioning technique and finally impedance measurements of cells and particles of different sizes and types to demonstrate the differentiation of subpopulations in a mixed sample.},

  abstract = {Analysis of electric fields generated inside the microchannels of a microfluidic device for electrical lysis of biological cells along with experimental verification are presented. Electrical lysis is the complete disintegration of cell membranes, due to a critical level of electric fields applied for a critical duration on a biological cell. Generating an electric field inside a microchannel of a microfluidic device has many advantages, including the efficient utilization of energy and low-current requirement. An ideal microchannel model was compared with a practical microchannel model using a finite element analysis tool that suggests that the overestimation error can be over 10\%, from  2.5 mm or smaller, in the length of a microchannel. Two analytical forms are proposed to reduce this overestimation error. Experimental results showed that the high electric field is confined only inside the microchannel that is in agreement with the simulation results. Single cell electrical lysis was conducted with a fabricated microfluidic device. An average of 800 V for seven seconds across an 8 mm-long microchannel with the dimension of  100 μm × 20 μm was required for lysis, with electric fields exceeding 100 kV/m and consuming 300 mW.},

There are two relaxation processes on the dielectric spectrum of RBCs samples; one is related to the ions accumulated on double layer boundary of cells and the other to Maxwell-Wagner interface polarization. It was observed that along with the rise of temperature, the peak of dielectric loss moved to high-frequency area and the RBCs sample with higher PCV value got a lower peak. With characteristic relaxation time at various temperatures, RBCs relaxation activation energy and the relative permittivity of cellular membrane were calculated as being close to the known value of phospholipids.},

The device is capable of creating a self-aligned stream by manipulating the flow rate, Q in both sheath channel. The objective of this research is to study the effect of channel size variation on the fluid flow in the micro flow cytometer device. The flow rate ratio Qs/Qi is applied in order find the best flow rate ratio value between sheath channel and sample channel. Simulated results showed that when Qs is smaller than Qi, the stream size is bigger and the length of the stream is longer. However, Qs is equal to Qi, the stream becomes smaller and the length of the stream is shorter. Similary, when Qs is bigger than Qi, the stream becomes smaller and shorter. The results showed that fluid flow is better when the size of the channel is bigger.},

The use of one flow to focus another within a microfluidic channel has graduated from a two-dimensional to a three-dimensional process and the design principles are only now becoming established. This review explores the underlying principles for hydrodynamic focusing in three dimensions (3D) using miscible fluids and the application of these principles for creation of biosensors, separation of cells and particles for sample manipulation, and fabrication of materials that could be used for biosensors. Where sufficient information is available, the practicality of devices implementing fluid flows directed in 3D is evaluated and the advantages and limitations of 3D hydrodynamic focusing for the particular application are highlighted.},

As in the 3D focusing for Coulter counting, the electric current was transmitted through a flow stream with high conductivity and the sheath or focusing fluids were water (low conductivity). By adjusting the relative flow-rate ratios of the conductive solutions, further focusing of the sample solution could be achieved. To keep the device simple, and unlike the Vellekoop approach, only a single sheath stream was employed. The series of papers published on this system demonstrated that: (1) the sensing is tunable by altering the cross sectional area of the conducting stream (Justin et al., 2012; Nasir et al., 2010a), (2) the angle of input of the sheath fluid (and consequent momentum vector), as well as the relative flow rates of sheath and sample streams, dramatically impacts the shape of the conducting stream (Nasir et al., 2011), (3) there is a lower limit on the height of the conducting stream before diffusion of ions into the nonconducting stream is problematic (Nasir et al., 2010a), and (4) the sample stream can be moved across the electrodes for multi-analyte sensing (Nasir et al., 2010a).

  abstract = {The control of hydrodynamic focusing in a microchannel has inspired new approaches for microfluidic mixing, separations, sensors, cell analysis and microfabrication. Achieving a flat interface between the focusing and focused fluids is dependent on Reynolds number and device geometry, and many hydrodynamic focusing systems can benefit from this understanding. For applications where a specific cross-sectional shape is desired for the focused flow, advection generated by grooved structures in the channel walls can be used to define the shape of the focused flow. Relative flow rates of the focused flow and focusing streams can be manipulated to control the crosssectional area of the focused flows. This manuscript discusses the principles for defining the shape of the interface between the focused and focusing fluids and provides examples from our lab that use hydrodynamic focusing for impedance-based sensors, flow cytometry, and microfabrication to illustrate the breadth of opportunities for introducing new capabilities into microfluidic systems. We evaluate each example for the advantages and limitations integral to utilization of hydrodynamic focusing for that particular application.},

The micro chamber and the fluidic channel were fabricated using standard photolithography and soft lithography process. Conventional method by pouring PDMS on a silicon wafer and peeling after curing in soft lithography produces unspecific layer thickness. In this work, a multilayer-PDMS method is proposed to produce a layer with specific and fixed thickness micron size after bonding that act as an optimum light path length for optimum light detection. This multilayer with precise thickness is required since the microfluidic is integrated with optical transducer. Another significant advantage of this method is to provide excellent bonding between multilayer-PDMS layer and biocompatible microfluidic channel. The detail fabrication process were illustrated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and discussed in this work. The optical signal responses obtained from the multilayer-PDMS microfluidic channel with integrated optical transducer were compared with those obtained with the microfluidic channel from a conventional method. As a result, both optical signal responses did not show significant differences in terms of dispersion of light propagation for both media.},

There are four inlet ports and one outlet port. The fluids are all injected by syringe pumps. A sample flow stream was first vertically constrained into a narrow stream, and then horizontally focused on one small core region from a cross-section perspective, which is useful for cell/particle counting. We showed the numerical and experimental images of the focused stream shape from a cross-section perspective; experimental images were captured using a confocal fluorescence microscope. We also investigated the effect of channel aspect ratio on the vertical focusing effect using CFD simulations. The results showed that the sample flow can be focused successfully in the lower aspect ratio of the main channel (slightly greater than 0.5) in our design. Furthermore, the effect of the Reynolds number on the vertical focusing effect was also investigated. The numerical results showed that the rectangular-like shape of the focused stream from the cross-section perspective was deformed as the Reynolds number was high due to stronger secondary flows produced in the vertical focusing unit. This phenomenon was also demonstrated experimentally. The device only works well at low Reynolds numbers (approximately less than 5). The device can be integrated into an on-chip flow cytometer.},

  abstract = {Electrode polarization effects in dielectric spectra of highly conductive biological cell suspensions cause a severe difficulty in the estimation of dielectric parameters of cells under physiological conditions. This problem becomes particularly serious with the increase of the electrical conductivity of the sample, preventing the use of low frequencies in the characterization of biological systems, especially aqueous biological systems. Although a variety of methods to correct the electrode polarization have been proposed in the past, no simple technique for its correction has been available so far. Since the magnitude of the polarization effect can be time-dependent owing to changes in the conductance of the suspending medium or to possible alteration in the electrode surface structure, it is clear that correction procedure should be based on a kind of “self-correction” method, avoiding the so-called “comparison methods” which, on the contrary, require time-independent effects. This note is aimed to address this problem considering an electrode polarization modelled by a constant phase angle (CPA) element in series with the sample admittance. A scaling-law frequency dependence has found to describe the a.c. response of the interface between the electrode and the bulk electrolyte solution. Although this approach has been extensively proposed in the past in the analysis of dielectric spectra of biological suspensions, we have somewhat modified the way it has been previously applied and have re-examined in detail its effectiveness in typical systems of biological interest. The results give support to the proposed analysis, allowing the complete low-frequency dielectric spectra characterization at frequencies of the order of 1 kHz for samples with a bulk ionic conductivity as large as that of the order of 1 mho/m. Typical examples with different dielectric behaviours are extensively discussed in order to show the applicability of the proposed method to biological samples.},

  abstract = {Applications of ionic liquids at electrified interfaces to energy-storage systems, electrowetting devices, or nanojunction gating media cannot proceed without a deep understanding of the structure and properties of the interfacial double layer. This article provides a detailed critique of the present work on this problem. It promotes the point of view that future considerations of ionic liquids should be based on the modern statistical mechanics of dense Coulomb systems, or density-functional theory, rather than classical electrochemical theories which hinge on a dilute-solution approximation. The article will, however, contain more questions than answers. To trigger the discussion, it starts with a simplified original result. A new analytical formula is derived to rationalize the potential dependence of double-layer capacitance at a planar metal−ionic liquid interface. The theory behind it has a mean-field character, based on the Poisson−Boltzmann lattice-gas model, with a modification to account for the finite volume occupied by ions. When the volume of liquid excluded by the ions is taken to be zero (that is, if ions are extremely sparsely packed in the liquid), the expression reduces to the nonlinear Gouy−Chapman law, the canonical result typically used to describe the potential dependence of capacitance in electrochemical double layers. If ionic volume exclusion takes more realistic values, the formula shows that capacitance−potential curves for an ionic liquid may differ dramatically from the Gouy−Chapman law. Capacitance has a maximum close to the potential of zero charge, rather than the familiar minimum. At large potenials, capacitance decreases with the square root of potential, rather than increases exponentially. The reported formula does not take into account the specific adsorption of ions, which, if present, can complicate the analysis of experimental data. Since electrochemists use to think about the capacitance data in terms of the classical Gouy−Chapman theory, which, as we know, should be good only for electrolytes of moderate concentration, the question of which result is “better” arises. Experimental data are sparse, but a quick look at them suggests that the new formula seems to be closer to reality. Opinions here could, however, split. Indeed, a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations has shown that incorporation of restricted-volume effects in the mean-field theory of electrolyte solutions may give results that are worse than the simple Gouy−Chapman theory. Generally, should the simple mean-field theory work for such highly concentrated ionic systems, where the so-called ion-correlation effects must be strong? It may not, as it does not incorporate a possibility of charge-density oscillations. Somehow, to answer this question definitely, one should do further work. This could be based on density-functional theory (and possibly not on what is referred to as local density approximation but rather “weighted density approximation”), field theory methods for the account of fluctuations in the calculation of partition function, heuristic integral equation theory extended to the nonlinear response, systematic force-field computer simulations, and, most importantly, experiments with independently determined potentials of zero charge, as discussed in the paper.},

Initially a detailed description of what constitutes EP is provided and the problems that it induces. Then, we review some of the more popular models that have been used to describe the physical phenomena behind the formation of the ionic double layer. Following this we shall enumerate the common strategies used historically to correct its influence on the measured signals in DS or in IS. Finally we also review recent attempts to employ fractal electrodes to bypass the effects of EP and to offer some physical explanation as to the limitations of their use.},

  abstract = {Electrode polarization effects in dielectric spectra of highly conductive biological cell suspensions cause a severe difficulty in the estimation of dielectric parameters of cells under physiological conditions. This problem becomes particularly serious with the increase of the electrical conductivity of the sample, preventing the use of low frequencies in the characterization of biological systems, especially aqueous biological systems. Although a variety of methods to correct the electrode polarization have been proposed in the past, no simple technique for its correction has been available so far. Since the magnitude of the polarization effect can be time-dependent owing to changes in the conductance of the suspending medium or to possible alteration in the electrode surface structure, it is clear that correction procedure should be based on a kind of “self-correction” method, avoiding the so-called “comparison methods” which, on the contrary, require time-independent effects. This note is aimed to address this problem considering an electrode polarization modelled by a constant phase angle (CPA) element in series with the sample admittance. A scaling-law frequency dependence has found to describe the a.c. response of the interface between the electrode and the bulk electrolyte solution. Although this approach has been extensively proposed in the past in the analysis of dielectric spectra of biological suspensions, we have somewhat modified the way it has been previously applied and have re-examined in detail its effectiveness in typical systems of biological interest. The results give support to the proposed analysis, allowing the complete low-frequency dielectric spectra characterization at frequencies of the order of 1 kHz for samples with a bulk ionic conductivity as large as that of the order of 1 mho/m. Typical examples with different dielectric behaviours are extensively discussed in order to show the applicability of the proposed method to biological samples.},

The optimal volume fraction of cells in suspensions in the TDDS measurements was found to be 3\%–10\%. The erythrocyte and erythrocyte ghost suspensions were found to demonstrate a single dispersion which can be described by the Debye equation.

In particular, soft lithography offers the ability to control the molecular structure of surfaces and to pattern the complex molecules relevant to biology, to fabricate channel structures appropriate for microfluidics, and to pattern and manipulate cells. For the relatively large feature sizes used in biology (≥50 μm), production of prototype patterns and structures is convenient, inexpensive, and rapid.

  abstract = {MEMS devices are manufactured using similar microfabrication techniques as those used to create integrated circuits. They often, however, have moving components that allow physical or analytical functions to be performed by the device. Although MEMS can be aseptically fabricated and hermetically sealed, biocompatibility of the component materials is a key issue for MEMS used in vivo. Interest in MEMS for biological applications (BioMEMS) is growing rapidly, with opportunities in areas such as biosensors, pacemakers, immunoisolation capsules, and drug delivery. The key to many of these applications lies in the leveraging of features unique to MEMS (for example, analyte sensitivity, electrical responsiveness, temporal control, and feature sizes similar to cells and organelles) for maximum impact. In this paper, we focus on how the biological integration of MEMS and other implantable devices can be improved through the application of microfabrication technology and concepts. Innovative approaches for improved physical and chemical integration of systems with the body are reviewed. An untapped potential for MEMS may lie in the area of nervous and endocrine system actuation, whereby the ability of MEMS to deliver potent drugs or hormones, combined with their precise temporal control, may provide new treatments for disorders of these systems.},

This review describes the advantages of employing silicon as a mechanical material, the relevant mechanical characteristics of silicon, and the processing techniques which are specific to micromechanical structures. Finally, the potentials of this new technology are illustrated by numerous detailed examples from the literature. It is clear that silicon will continue to be aggressively exploited in a wide variety of mechanical applications complementary to its traditional role as an electronic material. Furthermore, these multidisciplinary uses of silicon will significantly alter the way we think about all types of miniature mechanical devices and components.},

  abstract = {A high-gradient electric field strength system, consisting of a chamber created from two concentric cylindrical electrodes and filled with glass beads, was constructed for the study of the dielectrophoretic separation of cells. The glass beads distort the electric field patterns and generate sites of high electric field gradients, which can capture cells by dielectrophoresis. In order to experimentally determine the efficacy of the system, yeast cells were injected into a constant flow through the system, and the number of cells trapped measured. The effects of changes in voltage, bead size and the size of the inner and outer electrodes on the trapping efficiency of the dielectrophoretic separation system were investigated. In addition, simulation and electric field analysis were carried out using FEMLAB. Results indicate that the trapping of cells occurs by a combination of mechanical trapping and dielectrophoresis. Analysis of the results allow predictions to be made for the optimum values of the voltage, bead size and size of inner and outer electrode for any high-gradient system, in order to generate sufficient electric field gradient for dielectrophoretic cell collection whilst reducing non-specific mechanical trapping.},

The influence of technological conditions on the composition and basic regular trends in the formation of the layers is established. Some of the dielectric properties of the chromium oxide nanostructures and the quality of the semiconductor-insulator interface are assessed.},
