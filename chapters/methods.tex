\subsection{PDMS Channel Fabrication}
\par The device microchannels were fabricated by pouring PDMS over a silicon wafer master mold. The master mold was created by patterning a silicon wafer with SU-8 photoresist to 

%SU-8 is a negative photoresist polymer that crosslinks under ultra violet light exposure.
