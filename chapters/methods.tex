\subsection{PDMS Channel Fabrication}
\par The device microchannels were fabricated by pouring polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) over a silicon wafer master mold. Through photolithography, a master mold was created by patterning a silicon wafer with SU-8 photoresist in  a process known as soft lithography. A 6"x6" 20,000 DPI negative transparency mask was ordered from CAD/Art Services Inc. with the emulsion face down. A general process flow is depicted in figure \ref{fig:soft_lithography}.

     \caption{Micro-channel manufacturing flowchart with SU-8 photoresist and soft-lithography.}
     \label{fig:soft_lithography}
 \end{figure}
\subsection*{SU-8 Master Mold}
\par Before photolithography, silicon wafers were cleaned in a piranha bath (mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide) for 15 minutes with a deionized (DI) water rinse, and dipped in a BOE solution (buffered oxide etchant; mixture of buffer and concentrated hydrofluoric acid) for 5 minutes with another DI rinse. The wafers were washed and dried in the SRD (spin rinse dry) machine. The wafers were baked at 205$^\circ$C for 10 minutes and allowed to cool for 10 minutes. This dehydration bake ensured that moisture was evaporated from the silicon surface.

    \label{fig:spin_coater}
\end{figure}

\par The wafers were coated with SU-8 (negative tone photoresist) on a spin coater (Laurel Technologies, ws-400; figure \ref{fig:spin_coater}). The spin coater rotates at a series of angular velocities in order to coat the wafer with the desired thickness of photoresist. About 4 mL of SU-8 2007 (\#07110769, MicroChem) was placed on the center of the wafer, spun at 400 RPM for 20 seconds to disperse the SU-8, and then at 1500 RPM for 35 seconds to spread the photoresist to a 10 $\mu$m thickness. After spin-coating, the wafer was soft-baked at 85$^\circ$C for 3 minutes and allowed to cool for 4 minutes.

    \label{fig:mask_aligner}
\end{figure}

\par The photolithography process was completed using the Cannon PLA-501FA mask aligner (figure \ref{fig:mask_aligner}). With the transparency mask centered over the wafer and the 365 nm glass-transparency filter in place, UV light was applied to the photoresist for 14 seconds with a total exposure of 140 mJ/cm$^2$. The wafer was baked at 85 $^\circ$C for 4 minutes with a 10 minute cool down.

    \label{fig:SU-8_master_mold}
\end{figure}

\par The wafer was developed in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (SU-8 developer, MicroChem) in order to remove the non-exposed SU-8 from the wafer. The wafer was placed in the SU-8 developer for 3 minutes and hard baked for 15 minutes at 210$^\circ$C. The result was a SU-8 patterned silicon wafer mold (figure \ref{fig:SU-8_master_mold}).

\subsection*{Soft Lithography}
\par The Dow Corning 184 Sylgard kit was purchased through Ellsworth adhesives for the PDMS supply. The kit comes with a base and a curing agent that cross-links the PDMS and increases the polymer's stiffness. The PDMS was prepared by mixing the base and the curing agent at a 10:1 ratio. The mixture was degassed under vacuum until the PDMS was free of bubbles (figure \ref{fig:pdms_vacuum}). The PDMS was then poured directly onto the SU-8 master mold until the PDMS covered the wafer with approximately 1/4" of depth. The PDMS-covered master mold was baked at 65$^\circ$C for at least an hour in order to cure the PDMS. The PDMS chips were cut from the master mold with a scalpel and peeled off the wafer.

\end{figure}


\par The finished product was a PDMS chip with the desired microchannel dimensions molded into the polymer surface.

\subsection{Electrode Fabrication}

\par The device electrodes were fabricated onto a glass substrate using the lift-off process (section \ref{sec:lift-off}). The process utilized a 6"x6", 20,000 DPI transparency mask ordered from CAD/art services Inc. A flow chart of the overall process is depicted in figure \ref{fig:lift_off}.

  \begin{figure}
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/electrodeFabrication.png}
     \caption{Electrode fabrication flowchart through the lift off-process.}
     \label{fig:lift_off}
 \end{figure}

\subsection*{Photolithography}

\par Glass wafers were prepared for the lift-off process by cleaning the wafers in a pirahna bath for 15 minutes with a DI rinse, and a 1 minute dip in BOE with another DI rinse before running the wafers through the SRD. The wafers were dehydrated by baking on a hot plate for 10 minutes at 200 $^\circ$C and allowed to cool for five minutes. 


\par The wafers were coated with ma-N1420 negative-tone photoresist on a spin coater (Laurel technologies, ws-400; figure \ref{fig:spin_coater}). The ma-N1420 photoresist is advantageous for the lift-off process since the developed photoresist has an undercut profile, and the cross-linked property of the negative photoresist is more durable than the "soft" positive photoresist. Before application of the ma-N1420, a primer was dispersed and then spun onto the wafer at 3000 RPM for 30 seconds to increase photoresist adhesion. Ma-N1420 was then dispersed onto the glass wafer, but before spinning, it was ensured that the photoresist spread to all edges of the wafer. The photoresist was spun at 2000 RPM for 35 seconds with a target of 2.5 micron thickness. The wafers were then soft-baked on a hotplate at 120$^\circ$C for 3 minutes to increase stability. 

\par The photolithography process was completed using the Cannon PLA-501FA mask aligner (figure \ref{fig:mask_aligner}). The glass wafer was placed in the aligner with a black tape backing in order to prevent light scattering and absorb radiation. UV light was applied to the wafer for 30 seconds for a total of 450 mJ/cm$^2$. 

\par The wafer was then developed for 60-90 seconds in  ma-D 533/3 developer and rinsed in DI water. At this step, the wafer was examined under a microscope to ensure the photoresist was fully developed with sharp patterns (figure \ref{fig:photoresist_microscope}). If not, the wafer was developed for another 10 seconds and reexamined. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/microscope_photoresist.png}
    \caption[Post-developed Ma-N1420 photoresist]{Post-developed Ma-N1420 photoresist. The two outlined areas depict areas of removed photoresist.}
    \label{fig:photoresist_microscope}
\end{figure}

\par After the photoresist was fully developed, the wafer was flood-exposed (i.e. no transparency) in order to improve stability. The photoresist was exposed 3 times for 40 seconds with a five minute rest between each exposure for a total of 1800 mJ/cm$^2$. Finally, the wafers were baked on the hotplate with a ramping temperature from 60 $^\circ$C to 100 $^\circ$C for 10 minutes and allowed to cool for 10 minutes. 

\subsection*{Metal Deposition}

\par To deposit the electrode metals onto the developed-photoresist wafer, the AGS reactive ion etcher, CrC-150 chrome sputtering system, and the Denton Desk V sputtering system were used to clean and sputter chromium and gold. The target metal deposition consists of three layers: a 125 \si{\angstrom} thick base chromium layer to facilitate adhesion of the electrode to glass, a 180 nm thick gold layer as the main conductor in the electrode, and a 42 \si{\angstrom} thick layer of chromium that will oxidize to an inert finish (figure \ref{fig:metal_deposition}).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/metal_deposition_diagram.png}
    \caption[Diagram of metal deposition onto photoresist-developed substrate]{Diagram of the three layered metal deposition onto photoresist-developed substrate.}
    \label{fig:metal_deposition}
\end{figure}

\par To prepare the photoresist-developed wafer for metal deposition, the wafers were exposed to an oxygen plasma to volatilize and remove organic residues. The wafer was placed under vacuum in the AGS RIE system and exposed to an oxygen plasma for 30 seconds (figure \ref{fig:AGS-RIE}). The CrC-150 sputtering system was then used to deposit 125 \si{\angstrom} of chromium at a rate of 250 \si{\angstrom} per minute for 30 seconds. Using the Denton Desk 5, 180 nm of gold was deposited at a rate of 180 \si{\angstrom} per minute for 10 minutes. A final 42 \si{\angstrom} layer of chromium was deposited with the CrC-150 at a rate of 250 \si{\angstrom} per minute for 10 seconds (figure \ref{fig:sputterers}).

    \label{fig:sputterers}
 \end{figure}

\par During the transition between sputtering systems, the wafers were kept under vacuum in order to keep them clean, and in the case for chromium depositions, to reduce the formation of chromium oxide which can significantly impair chromium-gold adhesion.

\subsection*{Lift Off}

The final step of the electrode fabrication process was to remove the photoresist with the undesired metal depositions. The wafers were submerged in Microposit remover 1165 for five days under constant agitation (figure \ref{fig:lift_solution}). To increase the speed of lift off, the solution can be heated to 65$^\circ$C.

\subsection{Device Assembly: Alignment and Plasma Bonding}

\par To assemble the PDMS chip the electrodes, the components were plasma bonded to create a water-tight seal that permits optical viewing. The PDMS and the glass electrode substrate were placed device-side up in the Cal Poly Microfabrication Lab's PDC-32G plasma cleaner. After pumping the plasma cleaner down to a vacuum, the device was exposed to an atmospheric plasma for 10 seconds.  

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption[PDC-32G plasma cleaner]{PDC-32G plasma cleaner used for plasma bonding.}
    \label{fig:pdc_plasma_cleaner}
\end{figure}

\par After plasma activation, a drop of ethanol was placed on the PDMS surface before placing the PDMS onto the electrode substrate. This created a liquid float barrier that prevented permanent binding for $\sim$5 minutes. The electrodes and PDMS microchannels were aligned by hand with a microscope set at 20X magnification for visual feedback. After proper alignment, the device was baked in an oven at 65$^\circ$C for an hour.

\section[Software]{Software Interface}

\par LabVIEW was used to interface with the NI-5421 function generator and the NI-5124 oscilloscope to package the circuit model, data acquisition, and data analysis into an impedance spectroscope program. The LabVIEW language was chosen due to the ease of connecting to the National Instrument hardware and the rapid development cycle. The program specifications include interfacing with the NI-hardware to run an impedance spectroscopy experiment, the ability to control the sweeping frequencies, the ability to switch circuit topologies, the ability to automatically run tests at specified intervals, the implementation of a data saving system that records the users settings for the experiment as well as the impedance spectroscopy results, and the ability to view and compare data.



\subsection{Architecture}

\par The LabVIEW program was designed with an event-driven state machine architecture and is diagrammed in figure \ref{fig:IS_software_design}. A state machine is a common LabVIEW coding pattern where the program exists as a set of states. Depending on user input or calculations, each state leads to a subsequent state that can potentially lead to a large network of modular decision making code. For this program, the state machine is simple with most states leading to an idle state that continues to wait for user input. The state machine lives inside an event structure that listens for specific user interface (UI) interactions. These interactions trigger an event that runs code and can specify the next state in the machine. After a specified amount of time passes without an event triggering, the time out event will trigger and run the state machine.

    \label{fig:IS_software_design}
\end{figure}

\par The event driven state machine architecture allowed for a responsive UI that maintained the modularity of a state machine with safe program initialization and exit. The architecture was implemented to create two main modules: the impedance spectroscope, and the data viewer.

\subsection{Impedance Spectroscopy}
\par The impedance spectroscopy UI gives users the ability to control settings for experiments and view results (figure \ref{fig:is_gui}). All impedance spectroscopy settings are located in a set of three tabs: circuit topology, frequency parameters, and interval parameters. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/IS_gui.png}
    \caption{Impedance spectroscopy user interface}
    \label{fig:is_gui}
\end{figure}

\par The circuit topology tab informs the software of the circuit being used and the value of the external resistor (figure \ref{fig:labview_circuit_settings}). With each circuit selection, an image updates to display the measurement method and the required oscilloscope connections. In the current implementation, the software includes options for the I-V and auto-balancing bridge circuits. 

\par The frequency parameter tab controls the frequencies studied in the impedance spectroscopy experiment (figure \ref{fig:labview_frequency_settings}). The frequency expression shows how frequency values are calculated with x and y representing incremented values with the caveat that a value for every increment of x is generated for every one increment of y. For example, with the settings given in figure \ref{fig:labview_frequency_settings}, ten frequencies per decade with decades 1E3 to 1E7 are generated. The max input frequency truncates the frequencies generated to the specified value. In addition to frequency parameters, the tab also includes controls for the waveform amplitude, the number of cycles measured by the oscilloscope, and the sample rate.

    \label{fig:labview_IS_graphs}
\end{figure}

\par After running an experiment, the results are visualized and saved in a text file. The results are used to generate seven plots in four different tabs: impedance magnitude and phase, real and imaginary impedance, the Nyquist plot, and voltage bode and phase plots (figure \ref{fig:labview_IS_graphs}). With the exception of the voltage bode and phase plots, the graphs are different ways of visualizing the impedance data. The voltage bode and phase plots were primarily used in troubleshooting.

\end{figure}

\par Every experiment is automatically saved in a tab delimited text file with the designated experiment name (a number is appended to a filename duplicate; i.e. no files are overwritten) with the option to generate dated folders. Each file contains a header that saves the date and time the experiment was run, the user, and user defined settings. The impedance spectroscope data is saved in labeled columns. An example of a saved experiment file is given in figure \ref{fig:labview_data}.
\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Data Viewer}

\par The data viewer UI allows users to visualize and compare previous experiments (figure \ref{fig:labview_data_viewer_gui}). The UI allows up to ten experiments to be simultaneously plotted with a legend in the top right corner and a table to display each experiment's header information.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\section{System Implementation}
\par To run impedance spectroscopy tests, a system was assembled to control and record experiments. The complete implementation included a function generator (NI PXI-5421), an oscilloscope (NI PXI-5124), a hardware interfacing labview program, an I-V circuit, three Harvard apparatus syringe pumps, an inverted video microscope (LabSmith SVM340) for imaging, and the impedance spectroscopy microfluidic chip. Figure \ref{fig:IS_system} displays the impedance spectroscopy system. 

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/impedance_system}
    \caption{The impedance spectroscopy system}
    \label{fig:IS_system}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Electrical Interface}

\subsection*{NI Hardware}
\par The NI PXI-5421 function generator and the NI PXI-5124 oscilloscope were used to load and measure the impedance spectroscopy chip. The NI PXI-5421 is a 43 MHz waveform generator capable of generating user defined standard and arbitrary waveforms with a $\pm$6 V range and a 50 $\Omega$ output impedance. The signal generator was controlled with the LabVIEW program and operated to run at specified frequencies of a standard sine wave. The NI PXI-5124 is a 150 MHz 200 MS/s oscilloscope. The PXI-5124 has a 4.0 GS/s equivalent time sampling rate for repetitive signals, and a selectable 50 $\Omega$ or 1 M$\Omega$||29 pF input impedance. The oscilliscope was controlled with LabVIEW and configured to have a 1 M$\Omega$||29 pF input impedance.

\subsection*{Electrode Interface}
\par To establish an electrical connection to the impedance spectroscopy chip, solid core wires were soldered to to the device. Since the metal depositions were too thin for direct soldering, copper tape was placed adjacent to the electrode pads, soldered to the solid-core wire, and then a silver-based epoxy was applied to the copper tape and electrode pads using the M6 Chemicals silver conductive pen (figure \ref{fig:electrode_interface}). The epoxy has a resistivity of 1E-4 $\Omega\cdot$cm.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/electrod_interface.jpg}
    \caption[Impedance spectroscope electrode interface.]{The electrode interface consisting of solid-core wire soldered to copper tape epoxied to the electrode pads.}
    \label{fig:electrode_interface}
\end{figure}
\newpage

\par Connections to the NI instruments were made with solid-core wires soldered to BNC female jacks. Since the function generator output signal was not 50 $\Omega$ terminated, the signal amplitude will be twice the selected amplitude. Wiring length to the I-V circuit was minimized. 

\subsection*{I-V Circuit}
\par An I-V circuit, with an external resistor of 3300 $\Omega$, measured the impedance of the device under testing. The circuit was discussed in detail in section \ref{sec:impedance_spectroscopy}, and the implementation is depicted in figure \ref{fig:I-V_implementation}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/method_I-V.png}
    \caption[I-V circuit implementation.]{Implementation of the I-V circuit including impedance loads of the function generator and oscilloscopes.}
    \label{fig:I-V_implementation}
\end{figure}

\par The circuit was implemented using two different methods: a system of soldered solid core wires, and using a breadboard. There was no difference noted between the two implementations sweeping up to 40 MHz. However, the breadboard should generally be avoided for high frequencies due to intercontact capacitance ($\sim$25 pF for power strips, and $\sim$2.5 pF for the remaining breadboard).


\subsection{Microfluidics}

\par Three Harvard Apparatus syringe pumps driving 1 mL BD syringes were used to control fluid flow through the impedance spectroscope chip. The microfluidic network is diagrammed in figure \ref{fig:ufluidic_network}.

\par The original design of the device was meant to capture a single cell in the measurement chamber, but since this design cannot achieve single-cell isolation (section \ref{ch: introduction}), pump \#3 was used to initially flood the flush channels and then hold its syringe at a constant volume to prevent flow through the flush channels. For fluid flow, pump \#1 drove fluid at 1 $\mu$L/min and pump \#2 pulled fluid at 1 $\mu$L/min. 

%The flow with water was calculated to generate an estimated pressure difference of \#\# between the inlet and outlet, and a max gauge pressure of \#\# (appendix \ref{fluid_flow_pressure}).

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/fluidics_system.png}

    \label{fig:ufluidic_network}
\end{figure}

\par Spherotech polystyrene beads (FP-2052-2) were injected into the impedance spectroscope system for system evaluation. The Spherotech beads ranged from 7 $\mu$m to 7.9 $\mu$m in diameter and had a relative permittivity of 2.5 (table \ref{tab:permittivity_table}). The beads were mixed with a separate DI water and phosphate bufferred saline solution (PBS) at 0.1\% by mass. A single drop of Titron x-100 surfactant was added to both solutions and then sonicated.

\par The device was evaluated by making impedance measurements of DI water, PBS, polystyrene micro-beads.
