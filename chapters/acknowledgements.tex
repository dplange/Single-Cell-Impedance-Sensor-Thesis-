\par Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. David Clague. Dr. Clague's insights into impedance spectroscopy helped immeasurably. He is an incredible advisor and mentor who inspired me to question the status-quo and his continued support, motivation, and guidance with and beyond this thesis has been a source of tremendous personal growth.
\\
\par I want to make a special thank you to Dr. Ben Hawkins. Without his time resources, and support, the device would not have been fabricated at Cal Poly. It has been a pleasure to spend those long hours in the clean room with you.
\\
\par I'd like to thank Hans Mayer for his training and aide in the soft-lithography manufacturing process.
\\
\par I'd also like to thank Jack Foley whose companionship and collaboration inside the clean room was critical for delivering a functional device. 
\\
\par To the committee members, thank you for your time in considering this thesis.  
\\
\par To my friends and family, thank you for your unending support and guidance, without it, this thesis would not have been possible.
