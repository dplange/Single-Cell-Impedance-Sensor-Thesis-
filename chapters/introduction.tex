\par Cell detection and characterization are important for applications in medical diagnosis and food safety \cite{mansor}. With the advent of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), cell characterization techniques have developed with increasing precision and cost-effectiveness. One of these techniques is impedance spectroscopy. Cell impedance spectroscopy measures the electrical impedance of cell(s) over a range of frequencies and can differentiate between cell types, cell states, and provide information about cell components. With significantly increased manufacturing precision provided by MEMS technologies, cell impedance spectroscopy has been miniaturized to measure the impedance spectrum of single cells instead of macro suspensions. 

\par The applications of single cell impedance spectroscopy are extensive. In medical diagnostics, the ability to isolate a single

The ability to isolate In medical diagnostics a, such as identifying a single circulating tumor cell in a blood suspension for early stage cancer detection\cite{Mansor-1}, food safety, detecting E.Coli and Salmonella in water sources in rapid and inexpensive manner \cite{Mansor-3}.
