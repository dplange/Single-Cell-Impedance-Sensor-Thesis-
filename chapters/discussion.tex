\par The optimal device sensitivity changes with the sensor chamber height, width, cell size, and location.

\par When chamber height is restricted, a wider electrode becomes helpful, if not negligible. When the electrodes widen more current  is allowed to flow through the higher regions of the chamber and include . However, this has diminishing returns
